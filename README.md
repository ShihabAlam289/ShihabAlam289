# Customer Churn Analysis for Lloyds

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for Lloyds Bank using multiple datasets containing demographic, transaction, service interaction, and online activity data. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and provide actionable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple Excel sheets:
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, gender, location, etc.
- **Transaction History**: Transaction details and frequency.
- **Customer Service**: Customer support interactions.
- **Online Activity**: Web and mobile usage patterns.
- **Churn Status**: Indicates whether a customer has churned.

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Loading & Merging**: Merges all sheets using `CustomerID`.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and inconsistent data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes key trends in customer churn.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts useful features for churn prediction.
5. **Modeling & Prediction**: Applies machine learning models to predict churn.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, etc.)

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset and place it in the project folder.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore and preprocess the data.
3. Train and evaluate models to predict customer churn.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into factors affecting customer retention and helps Lloyds Bank make data-driven decisions to reduce churn.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional customer feedback data.
- Experiment with deep learning models for better predictions.
- Develop a dashboard for real-time churn monitoring.
